## Reminders for me:

- `npm install`
- `gulp` for mustache and less compiling, local server spinning
- `gulp postcss` for autoprefixing and css minifying
- There is no live reload because they are always more headache than help (Why??)

## To do:

- ~set up dev environment~
- Pretty much everything
